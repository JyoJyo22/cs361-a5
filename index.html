                <h3>About Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my index page. An index page is the default name for the home page of a website, 
                    depending on which web server that page is hosted on. This is the first page that users will
                    interact with when they visit a website, it usually provides navigation to all other pages for
                    the user. This way, the user does not have to include a specific path/file in the URL. They
                    can simply use the domain name in the URL and the server will serve the user this index page
                    if there is one. I created this index page with an HTMl file in VS Code. The &lt;head&gt; section
                    of the HTML file contains meta-data about how this file should be interacted with via browsers, screen
                    readers, etc. and the &lt;body&gt; section of the HTML file contains the client-constructed HTML
                    content that will be displayed in the viewport of the browser. This is how users can interact with
                    the content in this index.html file and this is how its content is constructed and displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we look into the browser's web dev tools, we can view details on HTTP requests and responses. 
                    We can find our index.html page here and inspect it, and find that we can get a 200 response for 
                    this index.html page. This means that our web browser sent a GET request to the OSU Apache server
                    and that Apache server sent back a 200 response which means "I have found what you requested and I
                    am returning it to you." We get 404 responses for both the main.css and main.js pages. This means that
                    these pages were requested by the web browser but there is a client-side error causing these pages
                    to not be located.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that this file has been transferred to the ENGR server, we can observe differences in the web dev tools. 
                        Most notably, the file served by my local machine lists no server and the host is listed as 127.0.0.1:5500. 
                    I have come to learn that this 127.0.0.1 can be called a "loopback IP address" and it allows a network to send a
                    response to the same machine that delivered the request. The :5500 part is the port where my local machine is
                    hosting the web page.
                        The file served by the ENGR server lists the server in the HTTP response header as "Apache/2.4.6" which is the 
                    server that the OSU ENGR department uses. In the HTTP request header we can see the host listed as
                    "web.engr.oregonstate.edu."
                        Another difference can be observed by viewing the HTTP response body. The file served by the ENGR servers lists
                        the HTML file exactly as it appears in the index.html file. The file served by my local machine includes a script
                        that is injected by the Live Server extension that I am using in VS Code in order to serve the web page locally.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The favicon.ico file returns a 200 status code because this image is injected by the server, the request is sent to
                    https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/favicon.ico and this page is properly located when one is on the ENGR server. 
                    The main.css and main.js however return 404 responses (client-side errors) because these pages are supposed to be
                    created by the client (me) but since these pages don't exist on the client-side then they can't be located via an 
                    HTTP request, so the server will not find them. These pages are referenced in the HTML file (via href) but they
                    were never created, thus they will return 404 until the client builds them.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the URL:       https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~houghtjo/assign1_houghtjo/.
                        The scheme in this case is https, which stands for "secured hypertext transfer protocol." This is the protocol
                    that the client uses to request resources from the server, and the "s" part means that this client-server 
                    communication is encrypted. 
                        The subdomain is web.engr, and this is used to access different sections/pages of the main domain. In this case
                    the ENGR subdomain is referring to the engineering "section/department" of the main oregonstate.edu domain. Thus
                    oregonstate.edu is the host domain, and it is called such because this is where the desired resource is being hosted.
                    This is where the client must send its request in order to find what it wants.
                        The desired resource(s) are in this URL as /~houghtjo/assign1_houghtjo/, and this specifies the path which
                        can represent the actual physical location of the resource on the server. It can also represent the path to 
                        a program which will serve the desired content.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    When we talk about frontend design we're simultaneously talking about user experience. In this sense, we can
                    imagine that many frontend developers are also UX designers, or would collaborate closely with UX designers. This
                    is to say that frontend developers must always keep in mind who their user is, what the user wants, what the user
                    might expect out of the given product, etc. There's a famous quote in the design world that goes:   "Always design
                    a thing by considering it in its next larger context - a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment,
                    an environment in a city plan." So when we design we're not just talking about visual appeal, but also usability and
                    context. 
                </p>

                <h5>Page Layout Tags</h5>
                <p>
                    The purpose of page layout tags is to organize the web page and make sure that page flows nicely. This is our
                    way of separating the contents of a page into sections like headers, footers, main section, navigation section, etc.
                    This comes back to usability, if our content is not organized and readable then users won't come back. We can style 
                    and customize these sections further with CSS.
                </p>
                <h5>Anchor Tags</h5>
                <p>
                    The anchor tags allow us to:  create links between different pages within our app, create links to specific
                    locations within a given page (we can use the "id" attribute for this, to bring the user to section "id"), 
                    and allow us to create links to external URLs. They do this via an "href" attribute which describes the location 
                    where the user will be taken once they click the link. 
                </p>

                <h3>Images & CSS</h3>
                <h5>Optimizing Images</h5>
                    There are 6 specifications that we can keep in mind whenever we want to optimize photos for the web:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Descriptive File Names
                            <p>
                                We want to include as much information as we can in the file names of our photo files, this way,
                                search engine bots and screen readers can make better use of our photos.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Small File Sizes
                            <p>
                                We want to make our photo file sizes as small as possible in order to minimize load times. One
                                of the ways we can do this is via image compression.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make Dimensions Exact
                            <p>
                                We have a certain space that our image will be within in our web page, we can crop and decrease the
                                size of our image such that it fits this space more appropriately.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Correct File Format
                            <p>
                                Different types of photos have different file types that accommodate those photos. Logos and icons 
                                go best with .gif, line-art is best suited with .png, interactive and/or animated images are best
                                with .svg, low to high quality photos are more suited towards .jpg, and very high quality photos 
                                will be best with .webp
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reducing the Resolution
                            <p>
                                We can adjust the resolution of our images depending on the monitor that will be displaying those
                                images. A lower-resolution monitor will perform better with lower-resolution images.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Color Mode
                            <p>
                                We want to use the RGB color mode for .webp, .svg, .jpg, and .png files, but for .gif files
                                we want to use Indexed color mode. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <h5>Why CSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for "cascading style sheets" and the reason we incorporate them into our web pages is so 
                    that we can give our web pages a specific look, a specific style, and also so that we can make our
                    pages more usable, readable, and engaging. CSS is what allows a brand to have its own style and 
                    marketing characteristics on the web. If our web pages were only built with HTML, then they would
                    lack the qualities that make users want to return to our site, thus CSS is how we incorporate 
                    usability and how we make our product stand out.
                </p>
                <h5>The 5-fold Path</h5>
                    There are 5 ways we can integrate our CSS with our HTML documents: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Externally-linked CSS files (preferred method)
                            <p>
                                We can link our CSS file in the &lt;head&gt; block of an HTML file with a statement like
                                the following:  &lt;link rel="my_stylesheet" href="main.css" /&gt; and we can also import our 
                                CSS component files as in the following:    @import my_component.css
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Style tags embedded in HTML
                            <p>
                                eg:    &lt;style&gt; h3 {color: orange;} &lt;/style&gt;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Inline HTML styles
                            <p>
                                eg:    &lt;h3 style="color: orange" &gt;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Javascript Template Literals
                            <p>
                                eg:    const my_heading = styled.h2`  color : orange;  ';
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Regular Javascript (interaction with the DOM)
                            <p>
                                eg:    document.getElementsByTagName('h3').style.color = 'blue';
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Page Layout Blocks</h5>
                <p>
                    It is important to specify page layout blocks in our HTML file not only so that the content of our page is 
                    organized, but also so that search engine bots and screen readers can navigate our page, thus aiding
                    usability. We then can use CSS to adjust the margins/borders/paddings around each of these layout blocks, as
                    well as add colors and any other styling we want.
